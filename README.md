# Phaser Pong
A gravity-based Pong clone made with Phaser.

To run the game, you need to install a web server. Out of Phaser's recommended web servers (http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3/part2), I used node.js's http-server while developing this game.

At least with http-server, the game works better when used via localhost:8080 (or whatever port yours will use) rather than the 127.x address, which uses the full resolution which turned out to be too big for my browser window when I'd already finished the game.
